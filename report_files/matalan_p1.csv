Hi IT,

The wave 202112050006 PS No Short With Singles has been started at 20:05 and it still seems to be in Wave Scheduled Status. We have double-checked all the parameters and everything seems to be correct on our side with no other waves running in the background.

Can this call be logged as a P1 as this is stopping us from running other waves and we are having outstanding volume for approximately 1.5 hours.

Please reply to all recipients of this message when sending an answer, all management has to be aware of the situation.
You can contact us on 0151 556 6899

Issue: Capgemini were asked to set up 639 users from a list that we provided them that originated from HR. This list included Last Name, First Name, role / job title and the users location. This was followed up with a further 107 users.

It has now transpired that Capgemini made an error in matching user account names and the account details of Head Office (HO) users have been sent to Store Users with a default password. If the Store User has attempted to access the account using the default password and then failed to gain access, they are likely to contact the service desk who may have automatically reset the account password. This will give the Store User access to the HO user account. A small sample of accounts has been taken and this has been found to include the account of the Rewards and Comms Manager.

The project team have been informed that they have 24 hours from 14:30 to provide a list to the Matalan Cyber Security Architect of any HO office account that has been exposed to Store Users so that we can identify if there has been any potential breach of GDPR.

Please contact first Incident Manager or Senior Agent. Do not raise HPI without any consultations.

Details: Please note that we have identified a live issue with the Matalan mobile app.

When a customer is attempting to make a payment in checkout, they are kicked back to the homepage of the app.

When the customer then attempts to checkout again they reach an error screen (page not found) after selecting their delivery method.

We have been able to replicate these issues in Android only. We were able to successfully place orders on both IOS and the Matalan website.

Can I please raise a call.

Meta pack system is not printing labels therefore we have had to stop packing due to this issue. Can this be raised as a matter of priority as it's stopped the packing process within the eCommerce operation therefore we are unable to despatch.

We have 38 orders that have not produced any labels.
